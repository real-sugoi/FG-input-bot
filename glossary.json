You might also hear this called Forced Choice, or 2AFC (2-Alternate Forced Choice).<br><br>Due to the wealth of defensive options in Virtua Fighter (including jumping, crouching, !<'backdash','backdashing'>, using !<'Defensive Move'>, and many more), each offensive action usually has multiple ways to defend. However, if you can generate enough !<'plus','plus frames'> (in VF5, +6 or higher is the !<'magic number'>), you can eliminate a lot of these defensive choices. To take the mid-or-throw example, a defender facing a nitaku would be left with a more or less binary guess; block the mid (and lose to throw), or try and attack so the throw doesn't work (and get !<'counter hit'> by the mid); picking any other defensive choice is very likely to lose to both offensive options. The guess is heavily in the offense's favor, leading to big !<'reward'> if they are correct.<br><br>Sometimes you'll hear \"reverse nitaku\", which is the same situation but talking about it from the defender's point of view. That is, rather than say \"you can attack or throw\", reverse nitaku suggests \"the defender can block or attack\". More advanced situations can crop up that branch into three options. You might have guessed this is called \"santaku\" for \"3 choice\".",
